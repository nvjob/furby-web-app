Web app for playing with a smart toy Furby.<br>
This is a web application for playing with the Furby smart toy through any browser (except IE).<br>
The application works with any version of Furby, but has only basic basic functions. <br>
The application allows you to: put Furby to bed, feed Furby, sing songs, speak and make different sounds by Furby themselves.<br>
For the application to work, you need to add sound. Furby must hear the commands.
